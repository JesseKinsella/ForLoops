#For loop allows you to execute a piece of code over and over again

#for number in range(10):
#  print("Hello")

#specify a range of numbers. Here, loop through 10 times. Then do what ever is indented on line 2. Here, print Hello

#for number in range(10):
#  print("Hello")
#  print("Hi there")

#each time you run the loop "number" holds a different value

#for number in range(10):
#  print(number) 

#"number" starts at 0, then 1...until range satisfied. Doesn't have to be "number". x is more common

#for x in range(10):
#  print(x) 

#list and For loops can work together

#fav_movies = ["Sandlot", "The Lego Movie", "Dune"]

#for movie in fav_movies:
#  print(movie)

#notice that range is just for int

#pretty powerful, the following takes a few seconds

#for x in range(100000):
#  print(x) 

# Loop 40 times and print the number of the loop times 2. E.G. 2,4,6...

for x in range(40):
  print(x*2) #0 base counting

for x in range(40):
  print((x+1)*2) #add 1 to number first
